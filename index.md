# Introduction

Climate change caused by human emission of greenhouse gas is an ongoing crisis that has and will continue to be a major part of our life.
A warmer ocean will bring more intense storms and hurricane, a warmer arctic has the potential to thaw ancient diseases that had been buried under the snow
and the vanishing ice caps will bring coastal floodings which will affect almost all major population centers around the globe.

Furthermore, even if we disregard the long term effects of global warming, the mining of fossil fuels has ravaged the environment in ways of oil spills,
waste water pollution and the shrinking habitats of wildlife. It is clear that we must switch a renewable sources of energy sooner rather than later.

However, even if people agree on the neccessity of renewable energy, there is still many questions and reservations toward the development of renewable
energy:
- Is renewable energy more expensive compared to fossil fuels?
- To what degree is a favorable geography neccessary for renewable energy production?
- How do we encourage renewable energy production in the most efficient way?

We will attempt to answer these questions using machine learning techniques performed on data from the EIA.
