# [Proposal](./proposal.md)

Climate change caused by human emission of greenhouse gas is an ongoing crisis that has and will continue to be a major part of our life. It is clear that we must switch renewable sources of energy sooner rather than later to eleviate and finally reverse this trend.

Current applications of machine learning techniques to renewable energy is mostly be limited to local prediction or optimization of renewable energy production and not on answering these important holistic questions. While forecasting wind power or solar power are doubtlessly important to move toward a fully renewable future, answers to holistic questions are much more import to policymakers and investors who shapes the development of renewable energy in their local states.

We will anwer these hollistic questions by using machine learning techniques performed on data from the Energy and Information Administration (EIA) and other sources of geographical, demographical and economical data.

# [Unsupervised Learning](./unsupervised.md)

Using unsupervised learning, we aim to answer the questions:
- Are states with similar (absolute and/or relative) renewable energy production similar in other features?
- Which features most strongly impact renewable energy production in states?

To answer these questions, we will use:
- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means
- Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM)

Our results along with the full report can be read [here](./unsupervised.md).
